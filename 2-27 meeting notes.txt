2-27 meeting notes:
demo:
- 10 nodes, mess with throughput to show scaling
- central server that displays the most recent message on each node
    - display on webapp or terminal output
things we need to have:
- message-passing
    - maintain a store, pass messages every once in a while, etc.
- maintain a network of nodes
    - each node has a list of addresses
-
on join:
- if everything has full list, ez
- figure out what nodes the new neighbors are:
    - http://disi.unitn.it/~montreso/ds/papers/montresor17.pdf this is a cool algorithm
    - page 9, section 4.2
    - this handles fault tolerance on its own
so the things we pass are:
- messages
- lists of nodes we're talking to (this updates the neighbor list)
- timestamp synchronization
